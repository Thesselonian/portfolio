**Eric Young**

This is a portfolio for me, Eric Young. I worked very hard on it and spent a lot of time knocking my head against it. I think it turned out alright. I hope you like it. 

*Future Work*

As I become a more compotent web developer and complete more work I will update this portfolio with my finished projects. 
Admittedly this is a bit of a rough draft. I focused primarily on the structure of the webpage and completing the assignment. When I actually intend to use it for the purpose of soliciting myself for employment I will polish it up and refine the content in a way that it is more appealing to the reader.
